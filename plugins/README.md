# This directory will store some plugins for SystemManager
These will come included but are not required for the functionality of the core program.

These plugins I wanted to have for the system. eg a plugin which will simulate a world where servers are cities and towns. (Thanks JustBetter, Company in Holland, for this amazing idea! full credits go to them!)
These are plugins to power 3rd party frontends who need more info than the API can provide. You can use the event system built into systemmanager to catch these events and run your own code for them!
